##RR alias of RemoteReference 

Instances of RemoteReference are used when you cannot send as copy an object that is the answer of some remote command.

The remote end will be able to use aRemoteReference asRemote and send a message remotely to it.

The reason for the short name instead of the long explicit one is merely bandwith optimization
